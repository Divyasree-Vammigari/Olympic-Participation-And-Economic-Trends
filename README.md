The Olympic Games are more than just a display of athletic excellence; they reflect a nationâ€™s economic resilience, investment in sports, and cultural identity. This project explores the intersection of economics and sports performance by analyzing data from 1960 to 2023, combining two comprehensive datasets:  

-Olympic Data: Medal counts, participation trends, and athlete demographics.  
-GDP Data: Annual GDP figures of participating nations.  

This analysis seeks to uncover the factors that shape Olympic success, addressing critical questions like:  
- Do wealthier nations dominate the Games, or do smaller nations defy expectations?  
- How does economic investment in sports influence medal tallies?  
- What cultural and regional elements contribute to success in specific sports?  
- How has Olympic performance evolved alongside economic changes?  

Advanced data integration and visualization techniques revealed key patterns, such as the significant impact of GDP on medal counts and the resilience of smaller nations excelling against economic odds. Challenges, including gaps in historical GDP data and variations in event formats, were addressed to ensure meaningful insights.  

The findings provide a nuanced perspective on global sports success, showcasing how opportunity and investment drive performance. The visualizations tell a compelling story accessible to policymakers, sports analysts, and general audiences alike.
